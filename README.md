# Ray Traying in C

This is my C implementation of "ray traiced" image rendering on the basis of a book ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/)
The output of images is a PPM(P3) file.

```bash
# Clone this project
$ https://github.com/smkatash/ray-traicing-in-one-weekend

# Run the program
$ make

# Render an image
$ make image

```
# Output of images in each chapter
