# Raytracing In One Weekend in C
This is a C implementation of the raytracer taught in the book [**Raytracing in One Weekend**](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

As I was writing the code, making up janky representations for classes and rolling my own vector implementation, I thought there was no way my implementation could be faster than the book's.

However, after finishing the final render, my C implementation ended up being about 3.5x faster than the C++ implementation presented by the book, while using the exact same raytracing algorithm and general program structure, so I am very pleased with the result.
